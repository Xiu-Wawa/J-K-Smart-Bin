# J-K-Smart-Bin
The J&amp;K Smart Bin is a simple futuristic trash bin with an embedded system in automation application that is able to sort paper and plastic automatically.





Significance of the Project

The results of this project would be of great help to the government, students, community, readers and future research in the following ways:

* Community - This would encourage every member of the community to take the responsibility of their own wastes with the help of the J&K Smart Bin. 
* Students & Teachers- This would help lessen their time having trouble in throwing their trash in the designated can, since the J&K Smart Bin will do the job for them.
* Government- The J&K Smart Bin could help efficiently implement the law of proper waste segregation.
* Readers- It would help them realize that we could use technology and create something whatever our world needs especially in waste segregation management. It would encourage them to do projects such as the J & K Smart Bin.
* Future Research- This study would help the future researchers as the basis of their study, an idea how to create an auto waste sorting machine.





                                                 Materials needed:
                                
                                  1. Trash Bin                        7. Arduino Uno 
                                  2. Power Supply                     8. Bread Board 
                                  3. Ultrasonic Sensor                9. Servo Motor
                                  4. Stepper Motor                    10. Jumper Wires 
                                  5. Capacitie Sensor                 11. A4988 driver 
                                  6. 4 Channel optocoupler module  
                                

 We used Arduino Uno Board, Stepper Motor, Capacitive and Ultrasonic sensors. These four are the major components of this prototype. 
 The Arduino Uno will serve as the programmable motherboard and controls all other parts. The sensors will identify the trash if it is plastic or paper. 
 The stepper motor is responsible for separation of wastes using a cylindrical board attached to it. A mechanical flap would then drop the waste inside the trash bin.
