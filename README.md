# J-K-Smart-Bin
The J&amp;K Smart Bin is a simple futuristic trash bin with an embedded system in automation application that is able to sort paper and plastic automatically.

Materials needed:

  1.Trash Bin                                                                        
  2.Arduino Uno                                                   
  3.Power supply
  4.Bread Board
  5.Stepper Motor
  6.Servo Motor
  7.Ultrasonic Sensor
  8.Jumper Wires
  9.Capacitive proximity sensor
  10.A4988driver
  11.4 channel optocoupler module

 We used Arduino Uno Board, Stepper Motor, Capacitive and Ultrasonic sensors. These four are the major components of this prototype. The Arduino Uno will serve as the programmable motherboard and controls all other parts. The sensors will identify the trash if it is plastic or paper. The stepper motor is responsible for separation of wastes using a cylindrical board attached to it. A mechanical flap would then drop the waste inside the trash bin.
